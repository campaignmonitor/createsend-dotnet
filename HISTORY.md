# createsend-dotnet history

## v5.0.0 - 16 May, 2017

* Events API added to the dotnet 4 wrapper

## v4.2.2 - 8 Oct, 2015

* Actually upgraded the createsend package set to Nuget

## v4.2.1 - 29 Sep, 2015

* Fixed an issue with date formatting on other cultures

## v4.2.0 - 10 Aug, 2015

* Transactional API added to the dotnet 4/3.5 wrappers

## v4.0.1 - 12 Feb, 2014

* Fixed an issue with the config transformations

## v4.0.0 - 6 Feb, 2014

* Updated to v3.1 API
* Added support for new segments structure
  * Create and Update calls now require the new `SegmentRuleGroups` structure, instead of a `SegmentRules` structure.

    ```csharp
    Segment.Create(AuthenticationDetails auth, string listID, string title, SegmentRuleGroups ruleGroups)
    Segment.Update(string title, SegmentRuleGroups ruleGroups)
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have created an argument like so:

    ```csharp
    rules = new SegmentRules {new Rule {Subject = "EmailAddress", Clauses = new List<string> {"CONTAINS example.com"}}}
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```csharp
    rule_groups = new SegmentRuleGroups {new SegmentRuleGroup {Rules = new SegmentRules {new Rule {RuleType = "EmailAddress", Clause = "CONTAINS example.com"}}}};
    ```
    
  * The Add Rule call is now Add Rule Group, taking a `SegmentRuleGroup` in a single `ruleGroup` argument instead of separate `subject` & `clauses` arguments.

    ```csharp
    Segment.AddRuleGroup(SegmentRuleGroup ruleGroup)
    ```

    So for example, when you _previously_ would have added a rule like so:

    ```csharp
    segment.AddRule("EmailAddress", new List<string> {"CONTAINS @hello.com"});
    ```

    You would _now_ do this:

    ```csharp
    segment.AddRuleGroup(new SegmentRuleGroup {Rules = new SegmentRules {new Rule {RuleType = "EmailAddress", Clause = "CONTAINS @hello.com"}}});
    ```
* Removed the ApiKey method to promote usage of oAuth authentication

## v3.1.3 - 13 Nov, 2013

* Updated reference to Newtonsoft to use 4.5.0

## v3.1.2 - 13 Nov, 2013

* Now using the correct ErrorResult objects when an exception is thrown. 

## v3.1.1 - 28 Oct, 2013

* Removed Newtonsoft dll's from the published nuget package. 

## v3.1.0 - 16 Apr, 2013

* Added support for [single sign on](http://www.campaignmonitor.com/api/account/#single_sign_on) which allows initiation of external login sessions to Campaign Monitor.

## v3.0.0 - 25 Mar, 2013

* Added support for authenticating using OAuth. See the [README](README.md#authenticating) for full usage instructions.
* Refactored authentication so that it is done at the instance level. This introduces some breaking changes, which are clearly explained below.
  * Authentication using an API key is no longer supported using the `api_key` config.

      So if you _previously_ entered an API key into a your `app.config` file (or similar) as follows:

      ```xml
      <configuration>
          <appSettings>
              <add key="api_key" value="your_api_key" />
          </appSettings>
      </configuration>
      ```

      If you want to authenticate with an API key, you should _now_ authenticate at the instance level. For example, as follows:

      ```csharp
      using System;
      using System.Collections.Generic;
      using createsend_dotnet;

      namespace dotnet_api_client
      {
          class Program
          {
              static void Main(string[] args)
              {
                  AuthenticationDetails auth = new ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails(
                      "your api key");
                  var general = new General(auth);
                  var clients = general.Clients();
              }
          }
      }
      ```

  * Instances of classes which inherit from `createsend_dotnet.CreateSendBase` are now _always_ created by passing an `AuthenticationDetails` object as the first argument. This may be either an instance of `OAuthAuthenticationDetails`, or `ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails`.

      So for example, when you _previously_ would have set your API key using the `api_key` config setting and then instantiated `createsend_dotnet.Client` instances like so:

      ```csharp
      var cl = new Client("your client id");
      ```

      You would _now_ do this:

      ```csharp
      AuthenticationDetails auth = new ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails("your api key");
      var cl = new Client(auth, "your client id");
      ```

  * Any of the static methods on classes which inherit from `createsend_dotnet.CreateSendBase` are now _always_ called by passing an `AuthenticationDetails` object as the first argument.

      So for example, when you _previously_ would have set your API key using the `api_key` config setting and then called `createsend_dotnet.List.Create()` like so:

      ```csharp
      var newListID = List.Create("Client ID", "My List", 
          "http://example.com/unsubscribe", false, "",
          UnsubscribeSetting.AllClientLists);
      ```

      You _now_ call `createsend_dotnet.List.Create()` like so:

      ```csharp
      AuthenticationDetails auth = new ApiKeyAuthenticationDetails(
          "your api key");
      var newListID = List.Create(auth, "Client ID", "My List", 
          "http://example.com/unsubscribe", false, "",
          UnsubscribeSetting.AllClientLists);
      ```
